This repository serves as an example of the code used in a project focused on studying Many Mode Floquet Theory and its applications to superconducting qubits. For detailed information, please refer to the accompanying report. Upon reasonable request, additional code can be made available.

The file "ShirleyFloquet.py" includes functions for performing numerical Schriefer-Wolff transformations, as described in arXiv:2302.12816.

The "LambdaSystem_Example.ipynb" script provides an illustration of the collision angles for the Lambda system. To execute the code, please unzip the "Data Example" folder. The data in this folder originates from simulations conducted on a cluster, and the relevant code can be found in the "Cluster Code" folder.
