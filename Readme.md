This repository contains an example of the code I used for a project.
The goal was to study Many Mode Floquet Theory and its applications
to superconducting qubits (see my report for more details). 
More code can be made available upon reasonable request.

The file "ShirleyFloquet.py" contains functions to do numerical 
Schriefer-Wolff transformations as described in arXiv:2302.12816. 

The script "LambdaSystem_Example.ipynb" illlustrates the collision angles 
in the case of the Lambda system. In order to execute the code one has to 
unzip the folder "Data Example". The data in this folder comes from simulations 
which have been executed on a cluster, the corresponding code is contained in 
the folder "Cluster Code".
