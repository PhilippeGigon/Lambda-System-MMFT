This repository contains an example of the code I used for a project. The goal was to study Many Mode Floquet Theory and its applications to superconducting qubits (for more details, please refer to my report). Additional code can be made available upon reasonable request.

The file "ShirleyFloquet.py" contains functions for numerical Schriefer-Wolff transformations, as described in arXiv:2302.12816.

The script "LambdaSystem_Example.ipynb" illustrates the collision angles in the case of the Lambda system. To execute the code, please unzip the folder "Data Example". The data in this folder originates from simulations performed on a cluster, and the corresponding code is contained in the "Cluster Code" folder.
